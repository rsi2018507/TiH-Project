The primary aim of this health monitoring/assistance device for wheelchair-dependent individuals is to address their unique needs and challenges. It helps track their overall health, well-being, and quality of life, and assists with their basic needs. The data generated by IoT sensors and signals from the Flex Sensor will be used to provide
assistance as per the user's needs. These sensors are integrated with a Libelium Arduino board or Raspberry Pi hardware board. The Arduino microcontroller is responsible for managing these health sensors and extracting relevant health information. The collected real-time data will be stored and managed through a cloud-based platform using Hadoop and Kafka to identify abnormal health conditions.
