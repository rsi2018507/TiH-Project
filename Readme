The primary aim of this health monitoring/assistance device for wheelchair-dependent individuals is to address their unique needs and challenges. It helps track their overall health, well-being, and quality of life, and assists with their basic needs. The data generated by IoT sensors and signals from the Flex Sensor will be used to provide
assistance as per the user's needs. These sensors are integrated with a Libelium Arduino board or Raspberry Pi hardware board. The Arduino microcontroller is responsible for managing these health sensors and extracting relevant health information. The collected real-time data will be stored and managed through a cloud-based platform using Hadoop and Kafka to identify abnormal health conditions. 

Aims and Objectives

This research is dedicated to developing a technology-driven healthcare support system that enhances the quality of life for individuals with lower-limb disabilities or those reliant on wheelchairs. By integrating advanced health monitoring, mobility assistance, and emergency response capabilities, the project aims to significantly improve the well-being and independence of its users. The specific objectives of the proposed system are articulated as follows:

● The Comprehensive Health Monitoring system caters to wheelchair users by tracking vital signs and activity levels, addressing physical health needs, and supporting mental well-being. Through Complex Event Processing (CEP), it predicts diseases by analying real-time sensor data, facilitating early detection and prompt medical intervention. The device can also provide timely recommendations and alerts, and gathers real-time data for analysis and assessment.

● To design a mobile application compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices, ensuring accessibility and convenience for comprehensive health monitoring of users. This functionality facilitates prompt communication, allowing messages to be sent to assistants, doctors, or caregivers, regardless of their location. Additionally, the application is equipped with a reminder system that notifies patients about medication schedules  and exercise routines tailored to their specific health requirements.

● To create a Wheelchair Users Health Monitoring Ontology (WUHM) is a comprehensive system tailored for monitoring the health of wheelchair users. It integrates medical guidelines and sensor data to support decision-making. By utilizing diverse data sources, it offers a holistic view of patients' health, aiding in disease detection and differentiation. Incorporating elements from existing ontologies ensures a nuanced approach to monitoring, supporting both historical and real-time data analysis. 

● Provide training and support to physically inactive users and caregivers on using the system effectively and making the most of its features.

● Conduct rigorous clinical trials and evaluations to assess the system's impact on improving health outcomes, reducing risks, and enhancing the quality of life for wheelchair users.
