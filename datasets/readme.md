1. Healthcare_IOT_Data (17.78KB)
2. 
This dataset represents simulated sensor readings from wearable devices used in an IoT-based healthcare system. It captures patient health data through sensors that monitor vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and battery status. These real-time measurements can be transmitted to healthcare providers, enabling remote monitoring and timely medical intervention.

Key Features:

Patient_ID: A unique identifier for each patient (string or integer).

Timestamp: The timestamp when the data was recorded, representing the date and time of each sensor reading.

Sensor_ID: A unique identifier for the sensor used to collect data (string or integer).

Sensor_Type: The type of sensor (e.g., 'Temperature', 'Blood Pressure', 'Heart Rate', etc.).

Temperature (Â°C): The body temperature of the patient, measured in degrees Celsius.

Systolic_BP (mmHg): The systolic blood pressure of the patient, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

Diastolic_BP (mmHg): The diastolic blood pressure of the patient, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

Heart_Rate (bpm): The patient's heart rate, measured in beats per minute (bpm).

Device_Battery_Level (%): The battery percentage of the device used to collect the data.

Target_Blood_Pressure: A predefined target for the patient's blood pressure, used for comparison or monitoring.

Target_Heart_Rate: A predefined target for the patient's heart rate, used for comparison or monitoring.

Target_Health_Status: The predefined health status of the patient, indicating whether they are healthy, under observation, or in need of medical attention.

Battery_Level (%): The actual battery level of the IoT sensor device used to collect and transmit the data.
