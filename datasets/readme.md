Datasets

1. Healthcare_IOT_Data (17.78KB)

This dataset represents simulated sensor readings from wearable devices used in an IoT-based healthcare system. It captures patient health data through sensors that monitor vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and battery status. These real-time measurements can be transmitted to healthcare providers, enabling remote monitoring and timely medical intervention.

Key Features:

•	Patient_ID: A unique identifier for each patient (string or integer).

•	Timestamp: The timestamp when the data was recorded, representing the date and time of each sensor reading.

•	Sensor_ID: A unique identifier for the sensor used to collect data (string or integer).

•	Sensor_Type: The type of sensor (e.g., 'Temperature', 'Blood Pressure', 'Heart Rate', etc.).

•	Temperature (°C): The body temperature of the patient, measured in degrees Celsius.

•	Systolic_BP (mmHg): The systolic blood pressure of the patient, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

•	Diastolic_BP (mmHg): The diastolic blood pressure of the patient, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

•	Heart_Rate (bpm): The patient's heart rate, measured in beats per minute (bpm).

•	Device_Battery_Level (%): The battery percentage of the device used to collect the data.

•	Target_Blood_Pressure: A predefined target for the patient's blood pressure, used for comparison or monitoring.

•	Target_Heart_Rate: A predefined target for the patient's heart rate, used for comparison or monitoring.

•	Target_Health_Status: The predefined health status of the patient, indicating whether they are healthy, under observation, or in need of medical attention.

•	Battery_Level (%): The actual battery level of the IoT sensor device used to collect and transmit the data.

3. Healthcare Dataset (8.4 MB)
The dataset available at- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset
This synthetic healthcare dataset is designed as a useful resource for those interested in data science, machine learning, and data analysis. It simulates real-world healthcare data, allowing users to practice, refine, and demonstrate their skills in data manipulation and analysis within the healthcare domain.

Each column contains detailed information about the patient, their admission, and the healthcare services received. This makes the dataset valuable for a wide range of data analysis and modeling tasks in the healthcare field. Below is a brief description of each column in the dataset.

•	Name: This column represents the name of the patient associated with the healthcare record.

•	Age: The age of the patient at the time of admission, expressed in years.

•	Gender: Indicates the gender of the patient, either "Male" or "Female."

•	Blood Type: The patient's blood type, which can be one of the common blood types (e.g., "A+", "O-", etc.).

•	Medical Condition: This column specifies the primary medical condition or diagnosis associated with the patient, such as "Diabetes," "Hypertension," "Asthma," and more.

•	Date of Admission: The date on which the patient was admitted to the healthcare facility.

•	Doctor: The name of the doctor responsible for the patient's care during their admission.

•	Hospital: Identifies the healthcare facility or hospital where the patient was admitted.

•	Insurance Provider: This column indicates the patient's insurance provider, which can be one of several options, including "Aetna," "Blue Cross," "Cigna," "UnitedHealthcare," and "Medicare."

•	Billing Amount: The amount of money billed for the patient's healthcare services during their admission. This is expressed as a floating-point number.

•	Room Number: The room number where the patient was accommodated during their admission.

•	Admission Type: Specifies the type of admission, which can be "Emergency," "Elective," or "Urgent," reflecting the circumstances of the admission.

•	Discharge Date: The date on which the patient was discharged from the healthcare facility, based on the admission date and a random number of days within a realistic range.

•	Medication: Identifies a medication prescribed or administered to the patient during their admission. Examples include "Aspirin," "Ibuprofen," "Penicillin," "Paracetamol," and "Lipitor."

•	Test Results: Describes the results of a medical test conducted during the patient's admission. Possible values include "Normal," "Abnormal," or "Inconclusive," indicating the outcome of the test.

This dataset consists of 10,000 records, each representing a synthetic patient healthcare record.It includes various attributes, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, admission details, and more.The dataset is intended for educational and non-commercial use. It is entirely synthetic and does not contain real patient data.
